Welcome to CogniDeep AI! We're a group all about learning artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Founded by Fahmi Zainal and co-founded by Hazman Naim, our mission is to create a space where everyone can explore and grow their knowledge.

In CogniDeep AI, we dive into exciting things like researching and developing in the fields of ML/AI, taking part in competitions to challenge ourselves, and having friendly discussions. We also have a book club where we read and talk about interesting resources including books, scholarly articles related to AI and data science.

Join us on this learning journey at CogniDeep AI, where we make understanding AI, machine learning, and data science simple and enjoyable!
